## Assignment


<ol>
  <li>
    The heat flow rate of a calorimeter can be directly related to the heat capacity and temperature change. Discuss.
  </li>

  <li>
    What is the difference between <strong>heat capacity</strong> and <strong>specific heat</strong>? Discuss.
  </li>

  <li>
    You mixed hydrogen chloride and sodium hydroxide together in a beaker. As a chemist, explain the reaction taking place in that system (include the balanced equation and energetics).
  </li>

  <li>
    A solution is formed by combining <strong>10 mL</strong> of solution A and <strong>40 mL</strong> of solution B. Find the heat of reaction assuming no heat is lost to the calorimeter, if the initial and final temperatures are <strong>20.4 °C</strong> and <strong>28.5 °C</strong> respectively. The specific heat of the solution is <strong>4.184 J·g⁻¹·°C⁻¹</strong> and the density is <strong>1.6 g·mL⁻¹</strong>.
  </li>

  <li>
    How will you determine the heat of neutralisation using a calorimeter? Discuss the procedure and calculations.
