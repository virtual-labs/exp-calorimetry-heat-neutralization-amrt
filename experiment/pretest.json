      "question": "A known volume of HCl solution of exactly known concentration is allowed to react with a strong alkali in dilute solution. Which of the following best describes the mentioned reaction?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Heat of solution.",
        "b": "Heat of dilution.",
        "c": "Heat of neutralization.",
        "d": "Heat of formation."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Heat of solution refers to dissolving a substance in solvent.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Heat of dilution involves adding more solvent.",
        "c": "Correct. This is a classic example of heat of neutralization.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Heat of formation relates to forming compounds from elements."

      "answers": {
        "a": "Heat of neutralisation of a acid",
        "b": "None of the above",
        "c": "Heat of Dilution",
        "d": "Heat of neutralisation of a base"

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The correct terminology involves base here.",
        "b": "Incorrect. There is a correct term listed.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This is about dilution, not neutralisation.",
        "d": "Correct. It refers to the baseâ€™s complete neutralisation."
